# NOT YET WORKING

I decided to push the half done server.lua this is purely as a back as my machine rolledback and I lost progress.

## TODOS

- Continue rewriting server.lua and remove the callback hell, keep function based but with promises.
- actually get it working with new format
- rewrite ui in react (later)

## EchoRP MDT QBCore Edit (WIP)

This is still a work in progress please wait for 1.0 release.
